  This application is a  command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.
  ## Installation:
  Make sure you have ```package.json``` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running ```npm init``` and then ```npm install```.
  ## Usage:
  When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

  When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
  When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
